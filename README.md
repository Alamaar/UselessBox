1. Closes switch
2. Slowly move arm to close switch
3. Jerks back and fort the arm before closing the switch
4. Peak, Close Switch, Peak, 
5. Waits users hand to be at least 25 cm away before closing the switch.
6. Moves arm according to how close users hand is. Lasts 20 seconds. 

7. Play music. Plays Star Wars Imperial march from speaker and moves arm in beat of the song.

8. Random function. Randomises arm movements and time to taken close the switch. 

9. Peak. Peaks if unused for five times before going sleep

10. Tilt sound. If device is not flat, it makes sound depending on the angle. Self-calibrates when arduino is first powered on. 


### Problems

* HC-SR04 canÂ´t accurately get users hand positions. Works better against flat surfaces.
